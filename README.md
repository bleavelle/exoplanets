# exoplanets

This project was inspired by stumbling upon the Exoplanet Archive by NASA. After cleaning in EXCEL and Python, I made a a fun viz in Tableau. I also used this data to try and train some basic machine learning algorithms in sklearn. 

The Jupyter notebook for the machine learning aspect of the project can be found in the files on this repository.
